This is a radio streaming application combining a **PHP/MySQL backend** with a **JavaScript/HTML5 frontend**. It enables users to:
- Stream MP3 files from a local server
- Upload music with metadata (title, artist, lyrics, cover art)
- Manage playlists dynamically
- Enjoy real-time audio visualization
- Control playback with advanced features

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Server Requirements
- **PHP 8.0+** with mysqli extension enabled
- **MySQL 5.6+** database server
- **Apache/Nginx** web server
- **777 permissions** on `/uploads` directory

### 2. Database Configuration
```sql
-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE loco_music;
USE loco_music;

-- Create songs table
CREATE TABLE songs (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  file VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  cover VARCHAR(255),
  artist VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  lyrics TEXT,
  uploaded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 3. File Structure
```
/project-root
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.php               # All-in-one PHP/HTML/JS application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db_config.sample.php    # Sample database configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db_config.php           # Your database configuration (gitignored)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .htaccess               # Apache configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /uploads                # Media storage (777 permissions)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ song1.mp3           # MP3 files
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cover1.jpg          # Album art
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md               # This documentation
```

### 4. PHP Configuration
1.  **Copy `db_config.sample.php` to `db_config.php`.**
    ```bash
    cp db_config.sample.php db_config.php
    ```
2.  **Edit `db_config.php` with your actual database credentials:**
    ```php
    define('DB_HOST', 'your_localhost');
    define('DB_USERNAME', 'your_db_user');
    define('DB_PASSWORD', 'your_db_password');
    define('DB_NAME', 'loco_music');
    ?>
    ```
    **Important:** `db_config.php` is included in `.gitignore` and should not be committed to your repository.

### 5. Directory Permissions
```bash
mkdir -p uploads/
chmod 777 uploads/
```

## üìÅ .htaccess File Explained

### 1. URL Rewriting
```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /
    
    # Route all non-file/directory requests to index.php
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]
</IfModule>
```
- Enables clean URLs by routing API requests to `index.php`
- Supports endpoints like `?action=getPlaylist` through URL rewriting

### 2. Security Settings
```apache
# Disable directory browsing
Options -Indexes

# Security: Disallow remote access to sensitive files
# Includes protection for configuration files like db_config.php
<FilesMatch "\.(env|ini|log|sql|bak|sh|config\.php)$">
    Order Allow,Deny
    Deny from all
</FilesMatch>
```
- Prevents directory listing
- Blocks access to configuration/backup files, including `db_config.php`.

### 3. PHP Settings
```apache
# Note: These settings can often be configured via your hosting control panel,
# which may override .htaccess directives.
<IfModule mod_php.c> # Changed from mod_php7.c for broader compatibility
    php_value upload_max_filesize 64M
    php_value post_max_size 64M
    php_value max_execution_time 300
    php_value max_input_time 300
</IfModule>
```
- Allows large file uploads (64MB MP3 files)
- Increases execution time for uploads

### 4. MIME Types
```apache
<IfModule mod_mime.c>
    AddType audio/mpeg .mp3
    AddType image/jpeg .jpg .jpeg
    AddType image/png .png
    AddType image/gif .gif
</IfModule>
```
- Ensures correct content-type headers for media files

### 5. Added Security Headers
The `.htaccess` file now includes several HTTP security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities:
- `X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"`: Prevents MIME-sniffing.
- `X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"`: Protects against clickjacking.
- `Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"`: Controls referrer information.
- `Permissions-Policy`: Restricts usage of sensitive browser features.
- `Content-Security-Policy`: Helps prevent XSS and other injection attacks by defining allowed content sources. (The current policy is basic and allows inline scripts/styles due to project structure).

### 6. Performance Optimization
```apache
<IfModule mod_deflate.c>
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/xml text/css application/x-javascript application/javascript application/json
</IfModule>

<IfModule mod_expires.c>
    ExpiresActive On
    ExpiresByType audio/mpeg "access plus 1 week"
    ExpiresByType image/jpg "access plus 1 week"
    ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access plus 1 week"
    ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 1 week"
    ExpiresByType image/gif "access plus 1 week"
    ExpiresByType text/css "access plus 1 day"
    ExpiresByType application/javascript "access plus 1 day"
</IfModule>
```
- Enables GZIP compression
- Sets caching headers for static assets

### 6. Request Limits
```apache
# Security: Limit file uploads (100MB max request size)
LimitRequestBody 104857600
```
- Prevents excessively large requests

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

Significant improvements have been made, but security is an ongoing process.

### 1. Database Credential Management
- **Improved:** Credentials are now managed in `db_config.php`, which is included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental versioning.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure `db_config.php` has appropriate file permissions on the server and is not web-accessible.

### 2. File Uploads
- **Improved:**
    - Server-side MIME type validation (`audio/mpeg` for songs; `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif` for covers) is now performed. Invalid files are deleted.
    - Filenames are sanitized to remove potentially problematic characters.
- **Note:** While improved, robust file upload security can be complex. Consider further restrictions or analysis if handling untrusted uploads in a more sensitive environment.

### 3. SQL Injection
- **Partially Mitigated:** Prepared statements are used for database inserts (`uploadSong` action).
- **Recommendation:** Review all database queries to ensure prepared statements or proper escaping is used consistently.

### 4. CSRF Vulnerability
- **Improved:** The song upload form (`uploadSong` action) is now protected by CSRF tokens.

### 5. XSS Vulnerability
- **Improved:** Lyrics submitted via the upload form are sanitized using `htmlspecialchars` before being stored in the database and when returned in API responses, mitigating direct XSS vectors through this field.
- **Recommendation:** Always ensure proper output encoding/escaping when rendering any user-supplied content on the frontend, even if sanitized server-side.

### 6. HTTP Security Headers
- **Improved:** The `.htaccess` file now configures several important security headers:
    - `X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"`
    - `X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"`
    - `Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"`
    - `Permissions-Policy` (basic setup)
    - `Content-Security-Policy` (basic setup, allows `unsafe-inline` for compatibility)
- **Recommendation:** For enhanced security, consider refining the `Content-Security-Policy` further, especially by moving inline JavaScript and CSS to external files to remove `'unsafe-inline'`.
